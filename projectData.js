                This very website is one of my ongoing projects! I built it from the ground up to serve as a central hub for my academic journey, skills, and creative endeavors. The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing platform to showcase my work and thoughts.

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Key technologies employed in its development include standard web languages: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionalities. Specifically, I leveraged <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for rapid and consistent styling, which allowed me to implement a modern design without writing extensive custom CSS. The <strong>Google Fonts API</strong> was used to bring in unique typography, enhancing the site's aesthetic appeal.
