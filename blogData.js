            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                My journey into practical web development took a significant step forward with my very first JavaScript project: a simple To-Do List application! This project, while seemingly basic, proved to be an invaluable learning experience, solidifying many foundational concepts of front-end development.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The core of the project revolved around <strong>DOM manipulation</strong>. I learned how to select elements from the HTML, create new elements dynamically (like new list items for tasks), and remove them when a task was completed. It was incredibly satisfying to see my JavaScript code directly influence what was visible and interactive on the page.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Implementing <strong>event listeners</strong> was another key aspect. Attaching listeners to buttons (for adding tasks) and to the list items themselves (for marking as complete or deleting) taught me how to make the application respond to user interactions. The <code>click</code> event became my best friend!
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">Key Learnings:</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 leading-relaxed">
                <li><strong>querySelector & createElement:</strong> Mastering how to grab existing elements and spin up new ones.</li>
                <li><strong>addEventListener:</strong> Making the page dynamic and reactive to user input.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic State Management:</strong> Even for a simple app, understanding how to keep track of tasks (e.g., in an array) and update the UI based on that data was crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS Manipulation:</strong> Toggling classes (like <code>line-through</code> for completed tasks) to visually represent changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Form Handling:</strong> Capturing user input from text fields.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Debugging was certainly part of the process, and the browser's developer tools became indispensable. Understanding error messages and using <code>console.log()</code> to trace variable values helped me pinpoint issues and ultimately made me a more resilient coder.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                This project, though small, built immense confidence and provided a solid foundation for more complex JavaScript applications. It showed me the power of JavaScript to bring static HTML to life.
